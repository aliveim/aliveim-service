aliveim-service was originally created in 2015 by Andrea Grandi.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Django that much better:

    Alessio Treglia <alessio@debian.org>
    Andrea Grandi <a.grandi@gmail.com>
    Andrea Stagi <stagi.andrea@gmail.com>
